This is a quick guide to get your Nvidia settings dialed in on Windows 11, especially relating to HDR and Gsync. It is a WIP as I am converting it from another guide I made. The Nvidia software stack is evolving pretty rapidly these days, and I will try my best to keep this guide up to date.
## HDR 
1. >Have an HDR monitor
2. >Make sure HDR is enabled on your monitor. You can google your model + settings and usually find a forum post with the best settings for your monitor.
3. >Enable HDR in Windows ![image2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e02318fe-b17c-42d1-b5fa-9734ed2a3ffc)
4. > Calibrate HDR for your display. Use this app from the Microsoft store to calibrate Windows HDR so it doesn’t look like shite as seen [here](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N7F2SM5D1LR?ocid=pdpshare). The last screen of the configuration is set to your personal taste, but *the internet* seems to think "70" is the best value, but go with what feels good!

**From here on are Nvidia specific instructions for folks with 3000 series or later cards.**
5. >Just to be sure, open up Nvidia Control Panel (should be installed automatically if you have Nvidia card, but if not you can download [here](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NF8H0H7WMLT?ocid=pdpshare). Make sure your monitor is set to the highest refresh rate possible and is set to use Nvidia color settings as seen here: ![image1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa8758c0-1a49-4947-9060-010c74448849)

6. >Nvidia's big game is upscaling. They have pretty decent AutoHDR for SDR content as well as upscaling for low resolution video. If you'd like to utilize these features, they can be enabled in the Nvidia App as seen below. At default, these settings are not enabled. <img width="1089" alt="upscale" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5320b768-58ac-472e-a1b1-15540ad88e54" />

7. >Profit! You are now gaming in HDR and SDR content shouldn’t look like old dog turds.
