This is a quick guide to get your NVIDIA settings dialed in on Windows 11, especially relating to HDR and Gsync. It is a WIP as I am converting it from another guide I made. The NVIDIA software stack is evolving pretty rapidly these days, and I will try my best to keep this guide up to date.
## HDR 
1. >Have an HDR monitor
2. >Make sure HDR is enabled on your monitor. You can google your model + settings and usually find a forum post with the best settings for your monitor.
3. >Enable HDR in Windows. If you open the Settings page and navigate to the System tab, you will find a Display option. You will see a box that says HDR with a toggle beside it. Click this box to open up all the HDR options. Set them as seen below.

4. > Calibrate HDR for your display. Use this app from the Microsoft store to calibrate Windows HDR so it doesn’t look like shite as seen *[here](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N7F2SM5D1LR?ocid=pdpshare)*. The last screen of the configuration is set to your personal taste, but *the internet* seems to think "70" is the best value, but go with what feels good!

**From here on are NVIDIA specific instructions for folks with 3000 series or later cards.**
5. >The rest of the settings can be configured in the NVIDIA app. You are given a choice whether to install this when you install your NVIDIA drivers. If you opted not to, the app can be downloaded on its own *[here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/software/nvidia-app/)*. Make sure your monitor is set to the highest refresh rate possible and is set to use NVIDIA color settings as seen here:

6. >NVIDIA's big game is upscaling. They have pretty decent AutoHDR for SDR content as well as upscaling for low resolution video. If you'd like to utilize these features, they can be enabled in the NVIDIA App as seen below. At default, these settings are not enabled. <img width="1089" alt="upscale" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5320b768-58ac-472e-a1b1-15540ad88e54" />

7. >Profit! You are now gaming in HDR and SDR content shouldn’t look like old dog turds.

## GSYNC
There are many guides online on how to utilize G-SYNC and many of them give differing suggestions or none at all. In my understanding, this is the way to properly utilize G-
SYNC. This will cover settings in the NVIDA app as well as which in-game settings to use.
1. >Obviously you need to be using a monitor that is G-SYNC capable. You can find this on the manufacturer's page for your monitor, and many of them have G-SYNC branding on the bezel somewhere. NVIDIA also keeps a database of G-SYNC capable displays *[here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/g-sync-monitors/specs/)
2. >Ensure G-SYNC is enabled for your primary display.

3. >Change your global settings as follows:
